The project from CC2013

The rules:
    - a) Board - Diogo 
    - b) Quad Tree Data Structure - Nikita  

The current questions:
    - Could we implement a bitmap by two dimensial array, 
    where each index has four following options (0 = empty, 
    1 = piece without being hitted, 2 = piece hitted, 3 = missed shot)?
