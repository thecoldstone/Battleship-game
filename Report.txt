The project from CC2013

//TODO
The deadlines:
    - a) ...
    - b) ...
    - c) ...
    - d) ...

The rules:
    - a) Board - Diogo, Nikita
    - b) Quad Tree Data Structure - Nikita
    - c) ...
    - d) ...      

The current questions:
    
    Question 1:
    - Could we implement a bitmap by two dimensional array, 
    where each index has four following options (states) (0 = empty, 
    1 = piece without being hitted, 2 = piece hitted, 3 = missed shot)?

        - Each pixel(index) of a board will contain information if there is a ship or not,
        basically 0 or 1, false or true resp.?

        - What is bitmap in your interpretation? Is it two dimensional array with 0/1 values?

        Quote from task: 
        - "The maximum piece size is a 5x5, 
        and should use a bitmap as the canonical form (the default shape of the piece). 
        All pixels must be adjects to each other, i.e., 
        every pixel must be connected to at least another pixel." 

            - Could you explain which data Structure we could use for representing board? It's a bit confusing task.
    
    Question 2:
    - Between ships should be at least one pixel distance? 

    Question 3:
    - What does it mean piece in your interpretation of task? Is it a ship or a cell(index of matrix)?

    Question 4:
    - The idea of the flow of program is:
        
        1. Board
            1.1. UserOne initialize the size of board (from 20x20 to 40x40)
            1.2. UserOne chose the location of their ships
            1.3. UserOne let UserTwo to do the previous step
            1.4. Once two boards are completed new empty board(matrix) appears
        2. Logic
            ActivePlayer=UserOne
            
            2.1 UserOne or UserTwo types the coordinates to make the shoot
                2.1.1 If he miss: ActivePlayer = UserTwo or UserOne
                2.1.2 ActivePlayer tries again
            
        THE QUESTION IS: If it's suitable idea for implmenting the game logic?
