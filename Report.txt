The project from CC2013

The rules:
    - a) Board - Diogo 
    - b) Quad Tree Data Structure - Nikita      

The current questions:
    
    - Could we implement a bitmap by two dimensial array, 
    where each index has four following options (states) (0 = empty, 
    1 = piece without being hitted, 2 = piece hitted, 3 = missed shot)?

        - Each pixel(index) of a board will contain information if there is a ship or not,
        basically 0 or 1, false or true resp.?
    
    - Between ships should be at least one pixel distance?

    - The idea of the flow of program is:
        
        1. Board
            1.1. UserOne initialize the size of board (from 20x20 to 40x40)
            1.2. UserOne chose the location of their ships
            1.3. UserOne let UserTwo to do the previous step
            1.4. Once two boards are completed new empty board(matrix) appers
        2.
